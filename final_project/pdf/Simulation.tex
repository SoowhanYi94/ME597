\section{Simulation} \label{Simulation}
%%Could you verify any of the theoretical steps/simulations- you can be selective here- i want you to show case what you have learned in this class to replicate or redo some of the results/simulations- this section is important as it would allow you to "showoff" what you have learned in 597!
