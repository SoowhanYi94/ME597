  abstract = {A novel characterization of bar-and-joint framework rigidity was introduced in [A.Y. Alfakih. Graph rigidity via Euclidean distance matrices. Linear Algebra Appl., 310 (2000) 149–165; A.Y. Alfakih. On rigidity and realizability of weighted graphs. Linear Algebra Appl., 325 (2001) 57–70]. This characterization uses the notion of normal cones of convex sets to define a matrix R¯ whose rank determines whether or not a given generic framework is rigid. Furthermore, this characterization was derived under the assumption that the framework of interest G(p) has an equivalent framework G(q) in Rn-1, where n is the number of vertices of G(p). In this paper we show that the matrix R¯ corresponding to a framework G(p) contains the same information as the well-known rigidity matrix R. Whereas the entries of R are a function of the positions of the vertices of G(p), the entries of R¯ are a function of the Gale matrix corresponding to G(p). Furthermore, while the number of rows of R is equal to the number of edges of G(p), the number of columns of R¯ is equal to the number of missing edges of G(p). We also show that the assumption of the existence of an equivalent framework G(q) in Rn-1 can be dropped and we give the precise relation between the left-nullspaces, and consequently the nullspaces, of R and R¯.}

abstract = {Data-based control design methods most often consist of iterative adjustment of the controller’s parameters towards the parameter values which minimize an H2 performance criterion. Typically, batches of input–output data collected from the system are used to feed directly a gradient descent optimization — no process model is used. A limiting factor in the application of these methods is the lack of useful conditions guaranteeing convergence to the global minimum; several adaptive control algorithms suffer from the same limitation. In this paper the H2 performance criterion is analyzed in order to characterize and enlarge the set of initial parameter values from which a gradient descent algorithm can converge to its global minimum.}
