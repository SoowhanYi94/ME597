%what is your assessment of the contribution of the paper/report? do you think the assumptions are reasonable? in what ways do you think the work could be complemented or improved? Often, for analysis, there are certain assumption used, for example, small angle approximations, or ignore higher order terms, or assuming the earth is non-rotating, or a particular frame is inertial, etc. In your view, are the corresponding assumptions valid or reasonable? how do you assess/propose that the work be improved?
